## About

Hienoa is a script for ircII-EPIC5. I started making hienoa because I wasn't fully satisfied with any of the irc clients and scripts available. I can't guarantee that you will be satisfied with this script, but I'm working on it.

## Installation

1. Download from github

    `git clone https://github.com/desaster/hienoa.git`

2. Add `load ~/hienoa/hienoa.irc` to your .epicrc

2. Start epic5

## Usage

The most important commands are /help and /config. However, there actually is no /help. Perhaps it's best if you find me on IRC and ask.
