0.53	* Implemented /help - works like the built-in /help, plus does a
	  keyword search if no help file was found
	* Added an option to append the sender's nick to DCC store path
	* Depend on epic4 >= 1.2.0
	* Removed extra whitespaces in log timestamps
	* Show /showbans in the CRAP window if available (requested by
	  skankke) (fixed for real this time!)
	* Made /cycle channel key aware
	* Automatic DCC accepting is now an userlist flag (+d). A downside
	  is that there's now no distinction between DCC CHAT and SEND.
	  Who cares?
	* If a window has no channel, ctrl-x cycles servers
	* Renamed autoreply to highlight notification (the word "autoreply"
	  had nothing to do with the feature). Configuration & themes are
	  affected
	* The highlight notification now displays the nick and the keyword
	  triggering the highlight
	* Added a "session" feature, that can be used to save and restore
	  the current servers, windows, channels & nicknames

0.52	* Fixed a typo that would cause a log entry to not be written
	  when quitting the client
	* Fixed a bug that could crash epic when doing massive amount of
	  mode changes
	* Fixed nightly log timestamp
	* Don't put raw dcc connections in awaylog
	* Added a 'paste' mode where tabs don't trigger the msg target
	  history, whitespaces are stripped off at the end of the line, and
	  lines that begin with the CMDCHAR are sent to the channel or query
	  target. Also added a new configuration option 'Paste mode timeout'
	  that sets the time when the paste mode is automatically set off
	  (default 0 = no timeout). Themes have been updated to include a
	  paste mode indicator.  The paste mode can be toggled with ALT-t
	* Disabled the reloading feature (ctrl-r) as it was rarely useful;
	  Instead of reloading hienoa.irc, the .ircrc or .epicrc should be
	  loaded. Users wanting this feature can add this command to their
	  .ircrc:
	      bind ^R parse_command load ~/.ircrc
	* Added an URL shortener that shortens long urls and serves them
	  with built-in web server (YES! A WEB SERVER!).  This is
	  configurable in a new /config submenu 'URL Shortener'
	* Made the default ban mask configurable via /config (requested
	  by Thorstein Klingenberg).
	* Made the lagmeter multiserver aware
	* New command "/tedit" for easy editing of channel topic
	* Show /showbans in the CRAP window if available (requested by
	  skankke)

0.51	* /theme now accepts a theme as argument
	* Implemented color assignment to nicks in public messages
	* === THEME BREAKAGES: ===
	  - The nickstatus() function should not be used in themes anymore
	    (it's done automatically now)
	  - The arguments for SEND_PUBLIC are now:
	      $0 = the channel the message is sent to
	      $1 = nickname with possible status prefix
	      $2- = text of message sent
	* Removed long kick-messages from etc/kick
	* /config tweaks; too long text values are now truncated on display
	* New command: /gourl - runs the configured command with %s
	  substituted by the last url seen (Configuration option:
	  URL grabbing -> URL command)
	* Fixed /zap <nonexistent nick>
	* Added support for new style keybindings (epic4 commit id > 338)
	* Fixed word highlighting when string has quotes, i think
	* Replaced epic's mode stripper with my own to avoid oddly
	  disappearing modes
	* Added support for dated directory hierarchies for log files
	  (as requested by liiwi)
	* Added support for prefixing log files by year, month and
	  full date (as requested by liiwi)

0.50	* Fixed /unignore (oops)
	* Added help-file for /unignore
	* updated themes.txt

0.49	* New configuration option: "Use gateway address for DCC" which is
	  toggle for epic's built-in DCC_USE_GATEWAY_ADDR
	* /url without arguments prints the last url grabbed
	* fixed flood.irc and window.irc to use 'package' command instead of
	  'module'
	* Removed "show underline in cyan" option
	* New command; /unignore <nick|hostmask>
	* Tabkey tweaks
	* Changed "Strip colors blah blah" to use epic's MANGLE_INBOUND
	  instead of invidual stripcrap() calls. (this restricts advanced
	  use of MANGLE_INBOUND, but that's ok)
	* Userlist's password saving was totally broken !
	* Global userlist flags didn't work in certain cases
	* Away-messages didn't get sent to channels that weren't "current"
	* New userlist flag; "i" - automatically joins channel if invited
	* Scrollz-theme updates by Timothy Cava

0.48	* Some help updates
	* Tab-completion tweaks
	* Removed the EXIT format (/quit now triggers CHANNEL_SIGNOFF)
	* The "fake" action in /away and /back now uses "..." as channel
	* Added PUBLIC_HL, PUBLIC_MSG_HL and PUBLIC_OTHER_HL formats.
	  These are used when a public message contains a matching
	  highlighted word.
	* Make sorting names alphabetically optional (Oskuro)
	* xterm tweaks
	* Added "set reverse_status_line off" to defaults.irc (solves color
	  glitches with new epic)

	* Added midnight-timestamp to autologging (only with channels)
	* Implemented word hilight in channel actions
	* Rewrote the flood protection to use epic's internal flood detection
	  (much simpler and not as cool, but -works- :)
	* Added /zap which works like /bankick but removes the ban after
	  specified period of time (DanielS)
	* Selective DCC auto-accept (config option "Nicks/hostmasks to
	  enable auto-accept for")
	* Logging of DCC events when away (config option "Log DCC events
	  when away")
	* Disabling nick completion doesn't disable nick completion
	  with tabkey anymore (Viiru)
	* Made disabling nick completion only affect automatic nick
	  completion (tabkey always completes nicks now) (Viiru)
	* Server-aware tab-completion for msgs
	* Some internal userlist changes; username can now contain any
	  characters
	* Removed the auto-unban feature (use /zap instead)
	* Removed "/hienoa latest"

0.47	* Fixed /wq
	* Missing %F and unneeded %S in splitfire theme
	* Fixed something in echoes theme
	* don't treat paths as commands, for example;
	    /etc/X11	is sent to the channel
	    /etc	is treated as command
	    /etc/	is sent to the channel
	    //etc	is treated as command
	  this is very nice for pasting stuff like df output :)
	* /addchannel's usage information was wrong
	* Added chanop checking to user protection
	* Added channel, nick and hostmask to AUTOREPLY format (milkpost)
	* Track nick changes in channels and update them in query windows
	  (by ljb@devco.net)

0.46	* Added CONFIG_TITLE theme format
	* Removed CHANNEL_INFO theme format
	* Removed cyancow theme (blue is much nicer color)
	* Small updates in "boring" theme (from hienoa-lzi)
	* Minor fix in /wq
	* Made "Strip colors/attributes from public and private messages"
	  clean topic changes too and moved it to "Look & feel"
	* Fixed typo in log_msg_timestamp config item which caused it to
	  not work
	* Don't reassign the original nick when doing /away twice
	* Away/backmessages didn't get displayed sometimes (hopefully fixed)
	* Changed many $N's in core/events.irc to $servernick()
	* modified notify_signoff to not try to show the hostmask at all
	  (all themes modified updated)
	* leading spaces didn't get displayed when using word hilighting
	* nicks with "\" didn't work well with dcc keybinding/autoget,
	  kludge added
	* bugfixes and cleanups in url grabber
	* added license (BSD-like), see doc/COPYRIGHT for more info

0.45	* Several minor bugfixes
	* Fixed userlist behaviour so global flags have effect only when user
	  has the channel in his channel-list (or no channels, *, which
	  means any channel)
	* New option "Strip colors/attributes from public and private messages"

0.44	* Added theme validator; etc/checktheme.py
	* Rewrote the userlist module;
	    - it now allows channel-specific flags
	    - addhost/adduser does NOT call userhost() to get the hostmask for
	      user if no host(s) were given
	    - /deluser takes only one user as argument
	    - /userlist requires wildcards (*) for non-complete usernames
	    - "a" flag can be auto-op or auto-voice depending on user's flags
	    - new CTCP command: VOICE
	* Fixed "Generate autoreply for hilighted words" option which
	  wasn't used (autoreply was always generated)
	* Changed /wn to do "window next" instead of creating new hidden
	  window

0.43	* Changed the help system; Symlinks of epic and hienoa help files are
	  created in ~/.hienoa/help. This is a hack so both epic and hienoa
	  help is shown in /help. The bad thing is that this feature
	  requires ln, so UNIX filesystem is needed. If this fails, epic
	  help is always available via //help
	* Fixes in /unban and /showbans
	* Autoback doesn't use the sent public message as backmessage (this
	  annoyed me, i'll make it optional if someone wants it)
	* Changed the config system, config entries are no more parsed
	  seperately. Update your home-made modules
	* Rewrote several parts of the config system (hienoa starts almost
	  35% faster now!)
	  -> New config format:
	    config_title "Foo Bar Blah"
	    config_entry "Title" type "text" var "h.cfg.huu" def "weird"
	  Quoting should be used as shown above
	* Added ctrl-w-s keybinding, does /window server ... (requested by
	  whitefang)
	* Fixed url grabbing, it didn't grab any urls :-O
	* Made bluecow the default theme, simple enough to not scare anyone?

0.42	* New configuration thingie, "wordlist"
	* Merged autoreply & hilighting into one feature, new wordlist
	  feature is used :)
	* Added config entry "Show away message on these channels only"
	* Removed option "Show channel users in reversed order"
	* Changes in STATUS_AWAY; $0 shows the number of stored awaylog
	  entries. All themes updated.
	* Flood detection is disabled by default (whoops)

0.41	* Small fixes from Daniel Bungert (he sent me mail about this 4
	  months ago, sorry the delay)
	* Removed old theme convert scripts
	* Added user@host to NOTIFY_SIGNOFF format
	* Fixed WHOIS_USERLIST format
	* Fixed /userflags (couldn't remove flags)
	* Added "ScrollZ" theme
	* Added "cyancow" theme.. and after ten seconds added
	  "bluecow" theme

0.40	* Internal reorganizing of config variables (you need to re-set all
	  of the config options)
	* Small bugfix in show-names-on-join event
	* Merged code from cthulhain;
	    - removed public flood protection (didn't work) and made the
	      configuration much simpler
	    - fixed url catcher
	    - ALT-I joins channel on invite
	    - formated away info will only show up now when the /whois command
	      is executed (implemented a bit differently than in hienoa-lzi)
	    - Bugfixes & additions in xterm code (these should've been
	      applied long time ago)
	* Added "boring" theme by soren

0.39	* Fixed a serious bug in url grabber (cthulhain)
	* Added "something" theme by cthulhain
	* Changes in NAMES_BOTTOM format:
	  $0 = channel name
	  $1 = number of users on channel
	  $2 = number of ops on channel
	  $3 = number of voices on channel
	  (number of non-ops can be determined by doing ${[$1] - [$2]}
	  All themes modified.
	* Made user listing work better on join (needs to be tested..)
	* Fixed SEND_DCC_CHAT in lice2 theme (kasper)
	* Some bugfixes in userlist code

0.38	* Notifylist is now saved to ~/.hienoa/config together with
	  variables. ~/.hienoa/notify is now obsolete, remove it.
	* Renamed showversion-helpfile to sayversion (ooops)
	* Several patches from tyrak (i'm glad someone keeps the development
	  going while i'm in the army ;))
	    - delayed auto-op (instant is no more)
	    - seperate awaylog-files (based on the pid of the client)
	    - auto-reply (i didn't add the special theme formats)
	* Removed all use of karll's arrays (use variable structures
	  instead). This also makes /config list entries in aplhabetical
	  order
	* Userlist format changed (old userlists don't work anymore, i might
	  do a converter some day)
	* Dumped the auto-unloading of modules; memory leak seems to be
	  gone (except with "/hienoa reload")
	* Fixed CTCP OP request so it checks that the user has the channel
	  in the userlist (bad security hole!)
	* Lots of new features by cthulhain (applied manually and modified
	  for my taste ;-)
	    - automatic contextual logging (see /config -> logging)
	    - user specific quit and kick files (~/.hienoa/quit and
	      ~/.hienoa/kick)
	    - lagmeter tweaks (partially merged)
	    - nick hilightling (implemented so it hilights (underlines) the
	      nick in the actual message instead of using special theme
	      formats)
	    - /wq <nick> - create a query window
	    - added new alias /cinfo to print various info (but not publicly)
	    - set client automatically back on send_public (partially)
	    - added an idle meter (STATUS_IDLE) to the status bar and updated
	      the default themes accordingly
	    - added internal filename/command/alias tabkey completion.
	    - added auto-accept for dcc send and chat requests
	    - reorganized the config menu
	    - added rudimentary flood protection.
	    - added a /url command to output the contents of the url log.
	      typing '/url <string>' will output all matches of <string> in
	      the log. typing '/url -c' will clear the log.
	      (gotta get rid of the karll-array code ;> -desaster)
	* Removed "set window level to NONE on connect" option (window level
	  is now set to NONE by default)
	* Added "show underline in cyan" option

	* Added simple /help and helpfiles for all commands (spellchecking
	  is welcome)
	* Renamed /showversion to /sayversion (which is the original name of
	  it .. i think?)
	* Added "/set high_bit_escape 0" to defaults - for real this time!
	* Bugfix in tabkey module
	* Renamed CTCP format to CTCP_CHANNEL (which makes more sense).
	* Wrote 0.35 -> 0.36 theme converter, etc/themecv-0.35-0.36.py
	* Fixed nasty bug in 0.32 -> 0.33 theme converter
	* Removed SEND_CTCP event, SEND_CTCP format is only shown if the
	  /ctcp command is used (this way sending internal ctcps like
	  CLIENTINFO is be invisible to the user)
	* Minor changes in /addchannel
	* Added /rot13
	* Added simple URL grabber

0.35	* New feature: change nick on away (requested by moijk)
	* Fixed config window so its not connected to any server

	* Cleanups in table code (/notify & /showbans)
	* Bugfixes & improvements in ban/unban code
	* Added STATUS_SERVER format and updated all themes
	* Wrote 0.32 -> 0.33 theme converter, etc/themecv-0.32-0.33.pl
	  (theme converters give me freedom to heavily modify theme format
	  without theme writers getting angry)

0.32	* Fixed minor bug in /config
	* Fixed minor bug in /wc
	* Fixed /config to accept empty values for text fields
	* Made "/hienoa latest" better

0.31	* Added dynamic keybindings for accepting or rejecting DCC requests
	* Fixed "transfer complete" with incoming transfers
	* Fixed xterm titlebar handling so no crap will pass to it (colors

	* Fixed a bug in nick completion
	* All WHOIS formats except WHOIS_AWAY now have server and nickname
	  as first arguments
	* Added new config section "DCC settings", this'll also contain XDCC
	  stuff if i write a xdcc module
	* Changed /config's look again
	* gunzip'd all files due to weird bug in epic which would cause a
	  jam after several continuous reloads (who would do that?-)
	* Added a check to tab completion so it only works if the cursor is
	  at end of the input line (i'll do tab-completion-in-middle later)
	* Fixed nick completion so the line will be saved to command history
	* Fixed /cycle
	* Internal topic list which also saves "set by" information
	  (requested by [Scotty])
	* New option: show channel & topic in xterm titlebar (only works if
	  the environment variable "TERM" begins with "xterm" or "rxvt")
	* /userlist now uses pattern match instead of excact match
	  ("/userlist simo" can find "[Simo]" and "simo")
	* Added "/set high_bit_escape 0" to defaults - does this hurt anyone?
	  if does then i'll remove it ;)

0.29	* Removed NAMES_END format (there's already NAMES_BOTTOM)
	* format argument numbers descended by one ($1 is now $0,
	  $2 is now $1, $3 is now $2 and so on) (hopefully no-one has written

0.28	* Corrected spelling in /slap
	* Major changes in theme system; colors are now set with &<color>
	  instead of %<color>, and statusbar codes need only one %
	* Reformatted all themes and removed some unneeded formats
	* SEND_CTCP format now works (if theme sets it)
	* Added /screenmode which can be used by scripts to switch to
	  highascii or lowascii mode

	  from LiCe)

0.27	* Removed duplicate config-entry for "max nicks in tabkey list"
	* Added /slap - woohoo!!

	* Renamed ChangeLog to CHANGES

	  begin with "module ..." instead of "package ..."
	* Cleanups & optimizations in format-module

0.22	* Fixed typos in etc/config, all options in "server stuff" now work
