About
-----

    Hienoa is a script for ircII-EPIC4. I started making hienoa because i
    wasn't fully satisfied with any of the irc clients and scripts
    available. I can't guarantee that you will be satisfied with this
    script, but i'm working on it.


Installation
------------

    Method 1:

    (1) Unpack hienoa
    (2) Put "load ~/hienoa/hienoa.irc" (without quotes) to your .ircrc
    (3) Start epic

    Method 2:

    (1) Unpack hienoa
    (2) Run ~/hienoa/hienoa.sh


Usage
-----

    The most important commands are /help and /config. If you don't know
    how to use EPIC or IRC at all, start with "/help 7 New_User" and
    "/help 7 Introduction" (note that you need to have ircII-EPIC help
    files installed)
