Synopsis:
   kickban [#channel] <nick> [reason]

Description:
   This command works just like KICK, but also bans the user.

NOTE:
   KICKBAN bans AFTER kicking the user, so if the server is lagged, the
   user might be fast enough to rejoin back to the channel before the ban is
   added.  *USE BANKICK INSTEAD*.
