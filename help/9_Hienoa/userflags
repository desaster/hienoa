Synopsis:
   userflags <user> <+|-><flag(s)> [#channel(s)] [+|-][flag(s)]

Description:
   This command adds and removes flags for user in userlist.  The following
   flags are currently implemented:

      c - can use ctcp commands
      d - auto-accept dcc requests from this user
      o - can request op (requires c)
      v - can request voice voice (requires c)
      a - auto-op/voice (requires o or v flag) (DANGEROUS!)
      b - auto-ban
      k - auto-kick
      p - protect op/voice
      i - automatically join channel if invited
   
   All flags (except d and c) can be channel-specfic.
   for example:
       /userflags desaster +a #foo +o #bar +v
   This means user has +o on #foo and +v on #bar and +a is a global flag,
   which in this case makes +v and +o automatic (on-join).
