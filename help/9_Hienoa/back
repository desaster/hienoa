Synopsis:
   back [back message]

Description:
   This command sets you back (if you were away).  Optionally it will show
   back message on all channels you are on.  If your awaylog has new
   messages, it will inform you about it.  If you have configured hienoa
   to change nicks on away/back, it will try to change your nick back to
   what it was before going away (NOTE: if you reload hienoa while away,
   the nick information will be lost and your nick will not be changed back).
