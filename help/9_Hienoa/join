Synopsis:
   join <#channel[,#channel],...>

Description:
   This is a wrapper to epic's JOIN command.  The difference is that if the
   channel name isn't a proper channel name, "#" will be added to the front
   of it.

   Also if you are invited by someone, you can join the channel by simply
   calling /join without arguments.
