Synopsis:
   notify [[-]<nickname> [[-]<nickname> ...]]

Description:
   This command is a wrapper to epic's NOTIFY command.  The only difference
   is that /notify without arguments shows nicely formatted list of who is
   offline and who is online (and on what server).

   If automatic configuration saving is enabled, the notifylist is saved
   automatically
