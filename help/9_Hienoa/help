   to epic's and hienoa's help paths).

Examples:
   To get help on the JOIN command (in section 1):
      /help 1 join

   To list all of the help files in section 1 (general-purpose commands):
      /help 1

   To list all help sections:
      /help
   
   To get help on hienoa's USERLIST command:
      /help 9 userlist

   To get help on JOIN command in any section (keyword search):
      /help join
