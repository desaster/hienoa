Synopsis:
   session [save|restore|delete] [session name]

Description:
   This command can be used to save and restore the current windows,
   servers, channels and nicknames. There can be multiple saved sessions,
   and if no session is specified as the last argument, "default" is used.

   With no parameters given, the command will list all available sessions.

Examples:
   To save the current state as the default session
      /session save

   To save the current state to a session "foo":
      /session save foo

   To restore the session:
      /session restore foo

   To delete the session:
      /session delete foo

Bugs:
   This feature saves the actual connected server address instead of the
   user specified irc server address. This means the possible advantage
   of round-robin dns entries that randomly choose a server, is lost.
